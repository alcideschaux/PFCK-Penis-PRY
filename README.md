## Introduction
In 2021, the US recorded 2,210 new penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cases, with mortality rates rising to 20%. Despite therapeutic advancements, the need to identify molecular and immunotherapeutic targets, especially PD-L1, became evident.

## Methods
Tissue samples from 108 SCC patients were examined using four tissue microarrays (TMA). Alongside the assessment of histologic features and PD-L1 and CD8 expressions, a machine learning model was employed. This model, constructed in Python, leveraged various statistical tests and methodologies to discern the predictive relationships between PD-L1/CD8 expression and pathologic features.

## Results
Histologic subtype was predominant in PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, explaining 13.5% variability, whereas combined with host response, it reached 20%. For intratumoral lymphocytes, host response stood out, explaining 11.2% of PD-L1 and 15% of CD8 variability. In peritumoral lymphocytes, host response again dominated, accounting for 21.1% of CD8 variability. Overall, host response emerged as a key factor influencing both PD-L1 and CD8 expressions.

## Conclusions
The study highlighted the crucial relationship between penile SCC's pathologic features and PD-L1/CD8 expression, emphasizing the therapeutic potential of these markers. By marrying traditional histopathology with machine learning, valuable insights for future therapeutic strategies in penile SCC were gleaned.
