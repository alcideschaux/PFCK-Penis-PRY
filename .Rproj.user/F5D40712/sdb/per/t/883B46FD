Considering the significant morbidity of the standard treatment, identifying novel molecular and immunotherapeutic targets is actively sought. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a coinhibitory molecule that impairs the T-cell response by down-regulating T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Tumor cells often up-regulate PD-L1 and thereby evade the host immune system. Recently, immune-checkpoint inhibitors have been proven effective against several tumor types, but data on PD-L1 expression in penile SCC is scant with only a couple of studies from low-incidence areas. In this study, we evaluate PD-L1 expression in a larger dataset of patients with penile SCC from a high-incidence area.\n\n\\   \n\n### Design\nWe built 4 high-density tissue microarrays (TMA) from 112 tissue samples of penile SCC and evaluated PD-L1 immohistochemical expression using a rabbit monoclonal antiâ€“PD-L1 antibody (Cell Signaling, Boston). We estimated PD-L1 percentage of positive tumor cells and positive peritumoral lymphocytes. Comparisons between PD-L1 expression and histologic grade and subtype were carried out using the Mann-Whitney U and the Pearson chi-squared tests. Binomial logistic regression models (LRM) were used to estimate odds ratios (OR).\n\n\\   \n\n### Results\nWe observed PD-L1 expression in 66% of TMA spots. We found a strong association between PD-L1 immunohistochemical expression and histologic grade (P=2.4e-10), with increasing percentage of positive tumor cells from grade 1 (median, 0%) to grade 2 (median, 1%) to grade 3 (median, 15%). PD-L1 positivity was also higher in high-grade tumors such as basaloid (median, 25%), warty-basaloid (median, 20%) and sarcomatoid carcinomas (median, 100%), with intermediate values in usual (median, 5%) and warty carcinomas (median, 5%), and low values in low-grade tumors such as papillary (median, 0%) and verrucous carcinomas (median, 0%) to a significant level (P=1.3e-14). Althought to a lesser extent, we observed a similar trend for PD-L1 positivity in peritumoral lymphocytes, both for histologic grade (P=0.02) and subtype (P=4.4e-5). In unadjusted LRM, we observed increased OR for high-grade tumors when evaluating PD-L1 expression in tumor cells (P=1.1e-5) and peritumoral lymphocytes (p=0.09). In the adjusted LRM, increased OR remained significant for PD-L1 expression in tumor cells (P=8.1e-5) but not for peritumoral lymphocytes (P=0.52).\n\n\\   \n\n## Conclusions\nOur results provide further support for the rationale of using immune-check point inhibitors in patients with penile SCC, especially in those with high-grade tumors.\n\n\\   \n\n***\n\n# **ABSTRACT #2:** Intratumoral Infiltration of CD8+/Ki-67+ Lymphocytes is Stronger in Higher Grade Penile Squamous Cell Carcinomas\n\n\\ \n\n## Background\nPenile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is an unusual genitourinary tumor for which the treatment options are limited once the disease has spread. Immune-check points inhibitors have shown promising results in other tumor sites but knowledge about the immune response associated with penile SCC is scant, with only a couple of studies on the subject with a small number of cases. In this study, we evaluate the immunophenotype of intratumoral and peritumoral lymphocytes in a large series of penile SCC.\n\n\\   \n\n## Design\nWe built 4 high-density tissue microarrays (TMA) from 112 tissue samples of penile SCC. We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of CD8, FOXP3 and Ki67 in intratumoral and peritumoral lymphocytes, counting the number of positive cells per high-power field (HPF). Comparisons between marker expression and histologic grade were carried out using the Mann-Whitney U and the Pearson chi-squared tests. Binomial logistic regression models (LRM) were used to estimate odds ratios (OR).\n\n\\   \n\n## Results\nWe observed an intense inflammatory host response in 50% of TMA spots. The median number of intratumoral CD8+ lymphocytes was significantly higher (P=1e-5) in grade 3 tumors (6/HPF) compared to grade 2 (2/HPF) and grade 1 (1/HPF) tumors. We observed a similar trend when counting the number of double CD8+/Ki67+ intratumoral lymphocytes (P=0.002). When considering peritumoral lymphocytes, the trend became non-significant for either CD8+ (P=0.92) and double CD8+/Ki67+ (P=0.05) lymphocytes. As expected, we found a strong association between Ki67+ in tumor cells and histologic grade (P=3.5e-9). Regarding FOXP3 expression, we did not observe a significant association with histologic grade for intratumoral lymphocytes (P=0.23) althought we found decreasing counts of FOPXP3+ peritumoral lymphocytes with increasing histologic grades (P=0.06). Finally, the CD8-to-FOXP3 ratio was not associated with histologic grade, either in intratumoral (P=0.53) or peritumoral (P=0.66) lymphocytes. In unadjusted LRMs, we found increased OR for high grade when evaluating counts of CD8+ (P=1.6e-4) and double CD8+/Ki67+ (P=1.6e-3) intratumoral lymphocytes. In the adjusted LRM, this trend remained significant (P=6e-5 and P=0.05, respectively). Finally, we found decreased OR for counts of FOXP3+ peritumoral lymphocytes, in both unadjusted (P=0.07) and adjusted (P=0.04) LRMs.\n\n\\ \n\n## Conclusions\nOur results show that higher grade tumors elicit an increased infiltration of intratumoral CD8+ and CD8+/Ki67+ lymphocytes. Additionally, we also observed decreased counts of FOXP3+ peritumoral lymphocytes with increasing histologic grades. These findings provide support for exploring the use of immune-check points in patients with penile SCC.\n",
